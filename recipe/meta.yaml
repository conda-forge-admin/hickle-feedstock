  summary: 'A HDF5-based python pickle replacement for dumping and loading python variables to file.'

  description: |
    hickle is a neat, quick way of dumping python variables to HDF5 files that can be read 
    in most programming languages. Hickle is fast, and allows for transparent 
    compression of your data (LZF / GZIP). Hickle is built upon h5py, and can be used as a
    drop-in replacement for pickle/cPickle.
